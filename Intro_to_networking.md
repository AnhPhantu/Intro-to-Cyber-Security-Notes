Data Link Layer (OSI Layer 2)
* Deliver data in a local network, data link layer devices like switch and bridge (Usually included mac adress)

Network Layer (OSI Layer 3)
* Deliver data between hosts and different network, (included IP address).

Adress Resolution Protocol
* Resolve MAC adress to its IP adress

Internet Control Message Protocol 
* Allows hosts to communicate about network conditions

DHCP
