# Chapter 3 Vocabulary
Welcome, I'm getting tired, but this is important vocab for chapter 3
##Vocab List
plaintext
* the real text

ciphertext
* the encoded message

cipher
* an algorithm that cann encoded plaintext

key
* info to cipher send to the receiver

encipher
* moving a plaintext to a ciphertext

decipher
* moving a ciphertext to a plaintext

Cryptography
* the study of encryption method

Cryptoanalysis
* the study of solving encryption method

Cryptology
* to include cryptography and analysis

Three independent dimension of cryptosystem
* type of crypto, numbered of keys used, way in which plaintext is process.

Brute Force Search
* a cryptoanalysis method that trying every possible key until a translation of the ciphertext to plaintext is obtained

Caesar Cipher
* shift and rotate letter on a agreeable number of rotation, however, there are oonly 25 possible rotation 

Monoalphabetic Cipher
* shuffle letter arbitrarily to create a cipher

Frequency Analysis
* analyzing letter frequencies and compared them to standard frequencies in the language used, which easily cracked subtitution cipher

Vigenere Cipher
* a polyalphabetic that is simple to used, an effective multipe caesar cipher

Kasiski Method
* used repetition is cypher text to give clue to keyword length. If keyword is N length, then cipher has N monoalphabetic subtition cipher

One time pad
* randomshift cipher but problem with finding key, but had perfect secrecy

Transposition Cipher
* Subtitution cipher that involve the subtitution  of a ciphertext symbol for a plaintext

Product cipher
* Cipher using transposition and subtitution is not secure because do not obscure language characteristic, so used more different type of cipher for a message to guarantee secrecy

Rotor Machines
* Used before modern ciphers method, these machine has a complexe subititution cipher method. Each cylinder give one subtitution which rotate and change after each encryption
